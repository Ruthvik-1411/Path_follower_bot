# Path_follower_bot
Using the simple application of line follower robot, I made two bots that are very similar to a line follower bot in terms of logic.<br>
<li>Line Follower Robot
<li>Wall Following Robot
<li>PID controlled Robot to move around a fixed object in a circle of radius, say 10cm.<br>
[As my tools were not working I could implement only the proportionate part of the PID algorithm.]<br>
